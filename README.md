# Employee-Management-system


Project Overview

This Spring Boot application leverages a robust technology stack:

Spring Boot: Streamlines application development with autoconfiguration and simplified Spring framework integration.
Spring Data JPA: Provides seamless persistence layer interaction with a MySQL database, mapping entities to database tables.
Spring MVC: Offers a clear model-view-controller architecture for building RESTful APIs and web applications.
Spring Security: Enforces secure user authentication and authorization, controlling user access to resources.
Thymeleaf: Enables creation of dynamic HTML templates for a user-friendly interface.
MySQL: Acts as the relational database for storing employee data.
Key Features

Secure User Authentication: Implements Spring Security for secure login functionality with multiple user roles:
Admin: Authorized for comprehensive employee management and additional reports.
Regular User: Permitted to view employee data.
Employee Management:
Admin:
View All Employees: Access a complete list of employee details.
Add Employees: Create new employee entries.
Edit Employees: Modify existing employee information.
Delete Employees: Remove employees from the database.
Regular User:
View All Employees: See a list of employee records.
Admin-Only Functionalities:
Total Salary: Calculate and access the total salary across all departments.
Attendance & Salary by Department: Gain insights into attendance and salary details for each department.
Elevated User Role (Admin)

To grant a user admin privileges, follow these steps (adjust based on your implementation):

Register: The user initially registers with regular, limited access.
Data Update (Manually or via Admin Panel): Update the user's role in the database from ROLE_USER to ROLE_ADMIN. This step requires implementation on your end (e.g., through a secure admin panel or another dedicated service).
Login with Admin Credentials: Once granted admin status, the user can log in using the updated credentials to access the full admin functionality.
Additional Notes

Replace // Implementation details with specific instructions based on your chosen authentication mechanism.
Prioritize security practices. Consider user password hashing, session management, and access control strategies.
Integrate error handling and validation for a positive user experience.
Explore unit and integration testing to ensure code reliability.
Consider using a dedicated user service for managing user roles and access.
Getting Started (Please Adjust Based on Your Project Setup)
